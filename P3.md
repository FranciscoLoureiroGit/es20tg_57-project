### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Login creates a tournament](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_57-project/blob/TdP/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/manageTournaments.js#L10)
 - [Login registers in a tournament](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_57-project/blob/TdP/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/manageTournaments.js#L16)


#### Rationale

É importante realizar testes end-to-end para garantir a integridade dos dados entre as várias componentes. O seu principal objetivo é simular cenários reais de utilização e verificar a correta integração das várias componentes do sistema, desde o frontend aos serviços e lógica de negócio definidos no backend.

#### Rationale
End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios, essentially testing how a real user would use the application. These tests allow us to cover sections of the application that unit tests and integration tests don’t cover. This is because unit tests and integration tests only take a small piece of the application and assess that piece in isolation. Even if these pieces work well by themselves, you don’t necessarily know if they’ll work together as a whole. 
In our project's case, e2e tests allow us to verify that all possible interactions with our frontend are functioning properly.
